Battleship, written in java for the CS112 Final Project at Amherst College (2017-2018). Written by Kyler Kopacz, Kaitlin Hoang, and Sam Rydzewski.

To compile: In terminal type javac *.java
To run: In terminal type java StartGame

Directions: There are 5 boats with lengths 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1. Once you start the game, choose a level and press start game.
Then the opponent's grid will appear and you need to shoot that grid by clicking a spot.
Then click the space bar which will show your boats and where the computer shot. Click the space bar again to change grids and take another shot.
Note: The space bar will cause the opponent to take its turn, if you click the space bar multiple times without clicking a square you will lose at least one turn.
A red dot means a shot and a green dot means a hit. When you've sunk a boat, the boat will appear on the grid.
When the game is over, the game over screen will display and close the window to start a new game.
You can play multiple games at once if you desire.

Additional notes: Although we struggled on this project (aka scrapping our code two nights in a row), it was really satisfying to see the final project.
We put a twist on battleship by adding the ability to choose levels, and we would've liked to add more twists if we have time.
